# Handwritten Character Recognition using Deep Learning

Basic CNN model trained using [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset) dataset to predict handwritten characters (letters and digits), each image is resized to grayscale 28x28px image. The model included in this repo is not perfect as I'm still learning to improve it. More explanation below:

### The Data

NIST characters dataset

MNIST digits dataset

To add more relevant data, ***Data Augmentation*** with the following properties were added:
   * Rotation (10 degree)
   * Scaling (10%)
   * Shifting (10%)


### CNN Architecture

Then the model is trained using the ADAM gradient descent algorithm, logarithmic loss, and a mini-batch gradient descent with mini-batch size 64 then saved model will be used to predict canvas image in Tkinter GUI.
